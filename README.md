## How to use this code
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger under "The Burgers that I still have." or "Devoured Burgers!" depend on your choice.
Each burger in "The Burgers that I still have." also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move down to "Devoured Burgers!" with the button "Not Hungry!" to bring it back to the previous area.

Visit the app site at Heroku below. If you wish to copy and edit the code, you will need to run ```npm install``` to retrieve the necessary dependencies.
